# <Challenge-6-Weather-Dashboard>

## Description

I was tasked with creating a weather dashboard which would output the current local weather for specific time windows, aswell as displaying the weather in a current location which the user specified while utilizing apis to retrive the weather data used in my project.

The completion of this project futher solidified my understanding of JQuery and Javascript aswell as making me more comfortable with using APIs. I now have a solid grasp on the topic and I beleive this is displayed in the finished product of my page.
